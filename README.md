# rProxy
Script that establishes a reverse ssh tunnel and configures nginx as a reverse proxy to tunnel traffic

this project is based on the blogpost from Jacob Errington on "Roll your own Ngrok with Nginx and reverse SSH Tunnel" 
(https://jerrington.me/posts/2019-01-29-self-hosted-ngrok.html)

Note: Its more of a proof of concept and also not finished. I'm happy if people are helping me to improve the script.
